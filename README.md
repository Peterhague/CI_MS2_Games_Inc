<li>To be able to get in touch with Games Inc. and contact them with their feedback</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-experience">User Experience</h2>

<p>The website is primarily designed for use on mobile and tablet devices, with a simple, clean layout with plenty of white
space. It is anticipated that the site's users will largely be under 16 and will tend access it via such devices. Where
images and additional graphics have been added for larger screens, these have been deployed mainly to break up some of that
white space created by the additional pixels, and where the feel had slipped from 'clean' to slightly 'empty'.</p>
<p>The main goals of the user experience design are to make clear immediately that this is a website offering educational
 games and to tempt users to play the games.</p>
<p>The first goal is achieved via the simple title advertising the Games Inc brand, in a typical "pixel art" style that 
users recognise as part of the gaming design language, as well as the prominent welcome message. The second is via bright, strong colours and cartoony imagery,
 designed to be attractive to younger users in particular, and a very clear, pared-down navigation bar offering clear access
 to the various games.</p>

<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Existing users in target market</li>
    <li>Potential users in target market</li>
    <li>Parents and care providers of potential users</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories</h3>
<p>
There are two main categories of user anticipated for the website: existing and potential players of the games, generally anticipated to be 14 and younger (henceforth "players"), and adults who would potentially recommend the site to children in their care (henceforth "responsible adults").
</p>

<h4>Players</h4>

<ol>
    <li>As a player, I want to be able to easily navigate to the game of my choosing.</li>
    <li>As a player, I want to be able to test my reasoning abilities.</li>

    <li>As a player, I want to be able to test my general knowledge and memory.</li>
    <li>As a player, I want to be able to contact the developers with my ideas and to engage with them on social media.</li>
</ol>

    <li>As a responsible adult, I want to be assured that they will not exploit or misuse their users' private information/</li> 
</ol>

    <li>As a site owner, I want responsible adults to feel assured that my website is a safe and rewarding place for yooung
    users to play, and to be happy to recommend it to them.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The project's scope in its initial release is limited to the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation bar to allow users to navigate the site quickly and easily, with bold underlining to show them which page they are currently looking at.</li>
<li>A brightly coloured footer with links to the firm's social media presence.</li>
<li>A home page with a large and prominent welcome message, and a form encouraging users to contact the owners with their suggestions for future games. The form is validated by Javascript code and interfaces with the emailJS API, informing the owners
of the new message and automatically sending the user a response.</li>
<li>"Minesweeper" page with a version of the popular logic-based game, with 3 selectable difficulty levels. The page loads to a
colourful call to action to play the game. The pixel art title is decorated with different randomly coloured tiles to recall the 
appearance of a minsweeper grid, and to add vibrancy and contrast with the white space.</li>
<li>"Spelling Bee" page with a spelling contest game, with 3 selectable difficulty levels. This page accesses the Responsive 
Voice API, to "speak" the words that the user has to attempt to spell. The elements are arranged to resemble and old-fashioned
computer monitor, with the game's messages displayed as if they were the monitor's text. The whole page is decorated in a 
yellow and black "bee" aesthetic, as a pun on the spelling bee title.</li>
<li>"Guess the Flag" page with a game quizzing players on their knowledge of world flags. This page uses the Country Flags API
to access a library of flag images that is randomised and displayed on each click of the play button. Each flag has a user input
for the player to type their guess at each flag's country. The page uses a blue and green "globe" aesthetic to match the flags theme, and the title has a fun flags motif with miniature flags adorning its letters.</li>
<li>A custom 404 "page does not exist" error page, with an error message and a prominent link to return to the home page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Features considered for later releases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A section on the homepage with news about upcoming projects.</li>
    <li>A custom version of the minesweeper game, with users able to select the number of rows and mines.</li>
    <li>A timer on the minesweeper game showing the seconds elapsed since the start of the game.</li>
    <li>The ability for users to sign up and log in, so they can keep track of their scores and look at live leaderboards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The general aesthetic is colourful, retro, pixel art. It is meant to evoke 1980s video games as well as provide lots of
strong colours to appeal to younger users.</p>

<p>This design language influences every element of the site, from the bold, "pixelalted" titles, to the simple and virbant footers, to the content of the games themselves. Almost all the colours on the website are bright and vividly contrasting with each other. Images are used sparingly, but where considered necessary to aid visual flow, have been chosen for their strong colours and cartoon aesthetic to sustain the overall appearance.</p>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>In general colours were chosen for their vibrancy and their appeal to younger users, with the home page dominated by bright pinks and blues. The game pages have themed colour schemes, but always with an eye on the guiding vividness.</p>

<p>The Minesweeper page is largely dominated by the grid itself, which has a bright green checkered effect. This grid does not appear on load, but the call to action uses the same colours to keep the look consistent. The Spelling Bee page is entirely yellow and black, as a fun play on the "Bee" in the title. The Guess the Flags page similarly echoes the blue and green of Earth to tie in with its subject matter.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>Cairo from Google Fonts is used for most of the text on the website, as it seemed to mesh well with the retro style of much of the site, while itself being readable but still pleasantly informal. Roboto from Google Fonts is used for the answers in the Flags game as it used less screen space than Cairo while maintaining a similar aesthetic. Press Start 2P from Google Fonts was 
used for the "display" in the Spelling game, to give an old-fashioned monitor effect.</p>

<h3>Imagery</h3>

<p>The images on the website take the form of large icons on the homepage to represent the 3 available games. They were taken
from larger images and had their backgrounds removed with online software. There are also cartoons of Rodin's The Thinker statue to decorate the call to get in touch on the homepage, and to focus the user on the form. The images on the website do not form a major part of the aesthetic and are used for emphasis of the prevailing design language.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The website has fifteen features across five pages (including a 404 error page).</p>

<h3>Current Features</h3>

<h4>Feature 1: Pixel Art Header</h4>

<p>Every page has a bespoke title using the same basic html elements but with modified CSS via Javascript code.</p>

<p>The heading-container div contains ten rows of one hundred small divs, which when coloured were designed to resemble familiar 'blocky' pixellated graphics.
These divs are coloured differently on each page to make up the title, for example spelling out 'Spelling Bee' and coloured in yellow and black stripes to resemble a
bee. Each page has its own fun and bespoke design.</p>

<p>This design is meant to be colourful and irreverent, appealing to younger users, and evocative of computer games in general.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 12: as a site owner, I want players to understand what kind of games my website offers and to encourage them to try them.</p>
<p>User story 14: as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>
<p>User story 15: as a site owner, I want the website to be attractive to younger users and keen gamers in particular.</p>

<h4>Feature 2: Navigation Bar for Desktop and Mobile</h4>

<p>Every page has a navigation bar designed to be easy to use and clearly separated from its surrounding elements.</p>

<p>To this end, a minimalist aesthetic has been employed, with no background colour, stark black type, and bold bright pink underlining for the current page.</p>

<p>For smaller screens, I chose to replace the wording with icons, but kept the basic layout rather than cluttering the design with a collapsible menu/burger-icon
combination. The colour scheme is maintained, as well as the distance from other elements. The pink underline is replaced with highlighting.</p>

<p>The navigation bar is easily accessible and almost always present on screen on both mobile and desktop, to facilitate good user experience and fast navigation.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 12: as a site owner, I want players to understand what kind of games my website offers and to encourage them to try them.</p>
<p>User story 14: as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>

<h4>Section 3: contact information</h4>

<p>This component consists of a Bootstrap-defined container with two columnar sections: left for the directions and contact information, and right for the map embedded via an iframe element.</p>

<p>This means that the section is fully responsive for mobile and tablet, with smaller screens adopting a single column configuration, with the map beneath the directions. This has been fine-tuned
via media queries so that the directions and the map are visible on a mobile's roughly 9:16 aspect ratio without the need to scroll.</p>

<p>I chose the black, slightly opaque background, for consistency with the overall design philosophy mentioned above. I chose unrounded corners for this component, as that was a better fit as a frame for the map.</p>
<img src="assets/images/contact-details-section.png" alt="contact details section and map">

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 1: as a potential stakeholder, I want to know where the firm is located.</p>
<p>User story 2: as a potential stakeholder, I want to know how to contact the firm and its key management personnel ("KMP").</p>
<p>User story 8: as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to sign up to use the client portal.</p>
<p>User story 9, as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to qucikly and easily log in to the client portal.</p>
<p>User story 10, as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to easily sign up for the firm's weekly newsletter.</p>

<h4>Feature 3: Meet the Team page</h4>

<p>The meet the Team page has one section: it introduces users to the firm's five key members of staff. This is written as a single Bootstrap container, with one row for each of the staff in
desktop format, and two rows for mobile and tablet.</p>

<p>The responsive design was achieved by writing one section for desktop and then copying and editing that for mobile, and then again for tablet. Different display classes were then applied
to each of the classes as necessary. I did this because the designs were different enough that this was quicker than writing media queries (e.g. the name of the staff member is in a different row depending on the screen size).</p>

<p>The slanted boxes on this page were achieved via transform:skew CSS rules, and chosen to add variety and visual dynamism to the website.</p>

<p>I chose the black, slightly opaque background, for consistency with the overall design philosophy mentioned above.</p>

<p>The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet screen sizes.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 3: as a potential stakeholder, I want to find out what the firm does and what it can offer me.</p>
<p>User story 4: as a potential stakeholder, I want to know who the KMP are, what their skills and experience are, and links to their social media presence.</p>
<p>User story 6, as a potential stakeholder, I want to discover the firm's culture and the personalities of the KMP.</p>
<p>User story 9, as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to qucikly and easily log in to the client portal.</p>

<h4>Feature 4: Our Services page</h4>

<p>The Our Services page has two sections:

<ol>
    <li>A section describing the four broad categories of services the firm provides</li>
    <li>A table detailing the firm's membership programme, and the benefits attached to its three different levels.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Section 1: the firm's services</h4>

<p>The responsive design was achieved by writing one section for desktop and then copying and editing that for mobile and tablet. Different display classes were then applied
to each of the sections as necessary. I did this because the designs were different enough that this was quicker than writing media queries (e.g. the left hand panes on desktop are resized and become headings on mobile and tablet).</p>

<p>I chose the black, slightly opaque background, for consistency with the overall design philosophy mentioned above. I opted for strict rectangles with no rounding because I wanted the title
panels to evoke the feeling of peering through windows to the scenery behind, and their counterpart descriptive panels therefore had to be the same shape for a pleasing symmetry.</p>

<p>All copy on the page was written by me.</p>

<img src="assets/images/services-panels.png" alt="our services panels: title and description">

<h4>Section 2: table summarising membership benefits</h4>

<p>The table was also duplicated for mobile and tablet, simply in order to display on smaller screens as a fluid container spanning the entire viewport. This was sufficient for the table to display in a legible and uncluttered manner, viewable without scrolling on most mobile devices. Various media queries narrative contractions were made for some of the smaller and more unusual screen sizes and aspect ratios.</p>

<p>The icons in the table were sourced from Font Awesome's library.</p>

<img src="assets/images/membership-programme-table.png" alt="table explaining membership programme and the various benefits at each level">

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 3: as a potential stakeholder, I want to find out what the firm does and what it can offer me.</p>
<p>User story 5: as a potential stakeholder, I want to fidn out about the firm's membership scheme and its benefits.</p>
<p>User story 8, as a potential stakeholder, I want to know about the firm's competencies and how its existing clients view its services.</p>
<p>User story 9, as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to qucikly and easily log in to the client portal.</p>

<h4>Feature 5: Navigation bar</h4>

<p>The navigation bar is displayed across the four pages consistently, with some minor changes to colour scheme in order that text always contrasts fully with the backgrounds specific to each page.</p>

<p>It uses the Bootstrap navbar component to leverage Javascript functionality to collapse the bar on mobile and tablet devices and replace with a "burger bar" toggle button.
</p>

<p>The desktop configuration also features a right-aligned (and therefore prominently isolated) "Sign In" call to action button. In mobile and tablet configurations, this button appears near the bottom of the viewport of each page's display on loading. This aids visibility, and also selection without the need to for users to obscure any of the page with their hand.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>

<p>User story 15, as a site owner, I want existing clients to be able to register for and log in to our client portal.</p>

<h4>Feature 6: Footer</h4>

<p>The footer is displayed at the bottom of all the website's pages. It is fixed to the bottom of the viewport on desktop and tablet devices.
The mobile configuration displays the items top to bottom, rather than left to right.</p>

<p>The footer displays mandatory statutory information related to the firm's professional registrations, its address, and social media links.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 1, as a potential stakeholder, I want to know where the firm is located.</p>
<p>User story 16, as a site owner, I want all users to as engaged with my business as possible, by reading our articles, signing up for services, and following us on social media.</p>

<h4>Feature 7: Sign In modal</h4>

<p>This feature is accessed via Bootstrap data-toggle buttons, and displays a form requiring users to submit their login details. There is an optional additional modal for users who have forgotten their details, which works via Bootstrap's data-dismiss class. The modal content is responsive to all screen sizes and required some granular tuning of button size and placement for some of the smaller devices.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 9, as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to qucikly and easily log in to the client portal.</p>
<p>User story 15, as a site owner, I want existing clients to be able to register for and log in to our client portal.</p>
<p>User story 16, as a site owner, I want all users to as engaged with my business as possible, by reading our articles, signing up for services, and following us on social media.</p>

<h4>Feature 8: Testimonials carousel</h4>

<p>This has been produced by editing Bootstrap's carousel component, by resizing the data indicators for enhanced visibility. It features three different slides each displaying three testimonies from DJR's satisfied clients. It is displayed prominently on the home page as an attractive first impression for new users, as well as to provide an immediate advertisment of the firm's qualities.</p>

<img src="assets/images/home-page-carousel.png" alt="carousel showing clients' testimonials">

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 7, as a potential stakeholder, I want to know about the firm's competencies and how its existing clients view its services.</p>
<p>User story 12, as a site owner, I want potential stakeholders to understand what my firm does and eoncourage them to become clients or employees.</p>
<p>User story 13, as a site owner, I want potential stakeholders to understand that existing clients are happy and receive an excellent service.</p>

<h4>Feature 9: News section with modal functionality</h4>

<p>The news section features three stories each accessible as a full screen modal via underlined "Read more" calls to action. The modals are Bootstrap components, and feature a white background as I decided that the pervasive dark containers of the website were not suitable for reading extended content. On mobile devices the modals require scrolling, so I added anchor elements with "up" arrow icons to allow users to instantly return to the top of the story, and therefore to be able to access the close button without scrolling.</p>

<p>User story 16, as a site owner, I want all users to as engaged with my business as possible, by reading our articles, signing up for services, and following us on social media.</p>

<h4>Feature 10: Newsletter call to action with form</h4>

<p>This component features a fully functional form that will not be submitted until all mandatory fields are completed in the appropriate format. The container is responsive for all screens and becomes centre-aligned on mobile devices.</p>

<p>User story 16, as a site owner, I want all users to as engaged with my business as possible, by reading our articles, signing up for services, and following us on social media.</p>

<h4>Feature 11: Portal registration call to action with form</h4>

<p>This component includes a long, fully-functional form with various input types. It uses the standard Bootstrap grid system to align two columns cleanly. It displays differently on mobile screens but retains all the same fields. The buttons required granular editing for size and placement on the various screen sizes.</p>

<p>User story 8, as a current stakeholder, I want to be able to sign up to use the client portal.</p>

<h4>Feature 12: Table of Membership Programme benefits</h4>

<p>This component also uses Bootstrap grid system to produce a responsive design for tablet and mobile. The headings feature colourful, attractive icons, and data is displayed in large, easily legible fonts for maximal accessibility.</p>

<h3 id="device-testing">Performing tests on various devices</h3>
<h4>Devices tested:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy A7</li>
<li>HP laptop</li>
<li>Motorolla</li>
<li>Ipad Pro</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tests performed:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Page links in the navigation bar work as advertised, all links work correctly in the static navbar and the collapsible mobile configuration.</li>
<li>The testimonials carousel displays appropriately, and the indicators are visible and work correctly.</li>
<li>The news stories open in modals as intended, with no scrolling on larger screens and full screen display and scrolling on mobile. The "top of page" arrow button works correctly on these devices, and the close button dismisses the modal.</li>
<li>The "Sign In" modal opens up correctly closes on a click outside the content or the cross button. The "forgotten details" link opens the subsequent modal and closes the first, as intended.</li>
<li>The "Sign In" modal form blocks submission when a mandatory field has not been completed in the required format - error message displays as intended.</li>
<li>Footer links to external websites work correctly, and open in new tabs.</li>
<li>The footer content spans the screen on larger devices, and collapses to stack on mobiles, as intended.</li>
<li>The newsletter sign up form container displays appropriately on all devices, remaining attractive and legible. The form blocks submission where any mandatory field is left unpopulated. An appropriate error message is displayed.</li>
<li>The portal registration form displays in two columns on larger screens and a single column, as intended. Content is legible and uncluttered across all devices tested.</li>
<li>The portal registration form will not submit unless all mandatory fields are completed. An error message displays as intended when triggered.</li>
<li>The contact details container displays as two columns on larger devices and one column on mobile. The content is legible and uncluttered across devices.</li>
<li>The staff profile containers display as intended on desktop, tablet, and mobile: there are three different layouts. This content needed to be resized on mobile layout to make it more legible.</li>
<li>The services containers display as intended as side by side on desktop and tablet and columnar on mobile. The content and headings are legible and attractive in all configurations.</li>
<li>The membership benefits table retains its integrity on mobile, with slightly contracted wording where required and the sacrifice of horizontal margins. Table on mobile remains legible and largely viewable without scrolling, as intended.</li>
<li>Buttons have the intended softening in colour when hovered over, as intended.</li>
<li>Page header redirects to home page on all pages</li>
</ol>

<p>All pages worked as intended on all devices. The one major change necessitated was to move the sign in button up a little in mobile mode, as I had not accounted for the screen real estate taken up by the browser elements.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs found and resolved during development</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The indciators on the testimonials carousel were not very visible against the background</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Created style rules for the previous and next icons and gave them larger width and height properties</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The carousel text was overflowing the container on smaller screens</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Created multiple media queries to adjust the container size and font-size on smaller devices</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The sign in button was not clickable</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>After significant investigation, this turned out to be a z-index issue, with the button being 'behind' the background. Assigned the background a negative z-index property</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The modals that were edited for a dark backgorund had 'cross' close buttons that were no longer contrasted with the background and had poor visibility</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Searched Google for the issue and discovered that this can be solved by assigning the elements a CSS property of filter and a value of invert(100%)</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The text in the password reminder modal was encroaching on the submit button on mobile devices</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Inserted a br element in the text with a Bootstrap classe "d-md-none" to display the text on two lines on small and extra small devices</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The reset and submit buttons on the sign in modal were poorly aligned with the input fields on smaller screens</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Wrote various media queries for different screen sizes to fine tune the alignment</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The lack of labels on the newsletter form (by design) failed WAVE accessibility standards</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Created labels but declared that they should not be displayed, so still there for screen readers etc</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The input fields on the portal registration form were of inconsistent heights</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>This was caused by the different input types defaulting inconsistently. Wrote CSS rule with a specific height to override the defaults.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The staff photos were overflowing their containers on very large screens (tested on 1920 x 1080px)</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Wrote a media query for min-width of 1400px with a max-width property to ensure no overflow regardless of screen pixel count</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The Our Services page was loading slowly due to large background image file</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Optimised the images, making the sizes smaller.</li>
</ul>
